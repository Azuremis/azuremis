# üëãüèæ Hi, I‚Äôm Azuremis

I‚Äôm a technologist driven by the magic that happens when cutting-edge AI meets the depths of human potential. As a Prime Mover at **AzuLabs**, I‚Äôm not just crunching numbers or writing code‚ÄîI‚Äôm crafting transformative solutions that spark innovation and elevate our collective consciousness.

At AzuLabs, I work at the vibrant intersection of **natural language processing**, **reinforcement learning**, **recommendation systems**, and **generative AI**. My approach is rooted in first-principles thinking, blending logic with creativity to design elegant, high-performance solutions using Python, fastai, PyTorch, and a suite of modern tools. I embrace every challenge as an opportunity to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.

But there‚Äôs more to my journey than algorithms and data. I‚Äôm equally fascinated by robotics, neuroscience, philosophy, and the very nature of consciousness. I believe that when advanced technology is intertwined with mindfulness and curiosity, it can redefine our world for the better. When I‚Äôm not immersed in code, you might find me experimenting in the kitchen, meditating to find balance, traveling to explore new cultures, or diving into a book like _The Untethered Soul_ by Michael A. Singer.
